# Description

SimpleTable was written in pure javascript with no dependency, for the exercice !


Here is a fully commented example :

```javascript

  // Settings like width and height, the id of the modal zone.  allowSearch gives you a search field
 var aConfig ='{"width":"700px","height":"316px","modal":"myModal","allowSearch":"yes"}';
    
    // Defining the header of the grid : colums names (matching data), types , titles and width
    // Supported types are : number, string and  mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy, dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy
 var aHeader = '{"arr":[{"name":"firstname","type":"string","title":"First name","width":"200px"},{"name":"lastname","type":"string","title":"Last name","width":"200px"},{"name":"birthdate","type":"mm-dd-yyyy","title":"Birthdate","width":"150px"},{"name":"langage","type":"string","title":"Langage","width":"150px"}]}';

    // This json string should be provides by the back-end : here for demonstration purpose
    // It's an objet containing an array 'arr' of objects representing the rows of our grid
    // You provide for each cell, the name (which must match the name in the header) and the value
var aData = '{"arr":[{"firstname":"Bjarne ","lastname":"Stroustrup","birthdate":"12-30-1950","langage":"C++"},{"firstname":"Denis","lastname":"Ritchie","birthdate":"09-09-1941","langage":"C"},{"firstname":"Kenneth","lastname":"Thompson","birthdate":"02-04-1943","langage":"Go"},{"firstname":"James","lastname":"Gosling","birthdate":"05-19-1955","langage":"Java"},{"firstname":"Brendan ","lastname":"Eich","birthdate":"07-04-1961","langage":"Javascript"},{"firstname":"Guido","lastname":"Van Rossum","birtdate":"01-31-1956","langage":"Python"},{"firstname":"Yukihiro","lastname":"Matsumoto","birthdate":"04-14-1965","langage":"Ruby"},{"firstname":"Roberto","lastname":"Lerusalimschy","birthdate":"05-21-1960","langage":"Lua"},{"firstname":"Rasmus","lastname":"Lerdorf","birthdate":"11-22-1968","langage":"Php"},{"firstname":"Jean","lastname":"Ichbiah","birthdate":"03-25-1940","langage":"Ada"}]}';
    
    // Optional feature (you don't need to set it via SetTranslations)
    // By default a button New title is 'New', you change it to localize or just to provide another title like "Add" 
    // Don't change the key, change the value ex : "New":"Nuevo" (Nuevo is new in spanish)
    
var aTranslation ='{"New":"New","Modifying":"Modifying","Adding":"Adding","Delete":"Delete","Cancel":"Cancel","Validate":"Validate","Search":"Search","Save":"Save"}';
    
    // Calling SimpleGrid : param1 : grid zone id, param2 : id of the grid itself, param3 : grid class (I propose grid-table grid-table-1 but you may write your own css)
var myTable= new SimpleTable("zone","tableId","grid-table grid-table-1");
    
myTable.SetConfig(aConfig); // Settting the config
    
myTable.config.save = function(){// Declaring the saving function
    // retreaving data
    var json = myTable.getData();
    // You got to make your own saving function to localstorage or back-end !
    alert('You got to send this Json string to your backend !\r\n'+json);
}
myTable.SetTranslations(aTranslation); // Setting translation if needed    
myTable.SetHeader(aHeader); // Setting the hearder with names, types and width
myTable.SetData(aData); // Setting the data to populate the rows
myTable.Draw(); // Drawing the grid in it's zone 


```
